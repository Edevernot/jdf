Welcome to the Joyner Document Format official LaTeX class.
This class was written and tested using a default MacTeX installation,
so it should work out of the box
as long as youâ€™re running an up-to-date LaTeX distribution.

## Quick start

You can clone this repo and try typesetting `jdf-starter.tex`
with the following commands:

    biber jdf-starter
    pdflatex jdf-starter

The result should look like `jdf-starter.pdf`.
* `biber` command generates used referenes from `references.bib` 
* `pdflatex` command generates the final pdf

## Local Setup
- **OS**: Ubuntu Linux 20.04

Finally, intsall texlive:
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

Use the preview icon (top left) or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Alt + V). This will open up a live preview.

Once done, use the green play button, or use keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Alt + B) to build the project and generate PDF.
